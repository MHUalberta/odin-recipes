    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This cake was sent home from our children's school. It is the simplest, best-tasting cake I've ever made. Great to make with the kids, especially for cupcakes.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9-inch square cake pan.</li>
        <li>Cream sugar and butter together in a mixing bowl. Add eggs, one at a time, beating briefly after each addition. Stir in vanilla.</li>
        <li>Combine flour and baking powder in a separate bowl. Add to the wet ingredients and mix well. Add milk and stir until smooth. Pour batter into the prepared cake pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the top springs back when lightly touched, 30 to 40 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
