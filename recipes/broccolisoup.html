    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I am not a broccoli person. I even used to hate broccoli - and now I'm ok with it. But you guys, this broccoli soup is OUTSTANDING. Like gimme-some-more-right-now outstanding. I'm not sure why, but you just can't taste this little bitter taste that I hate  don't like in broccoli (and cauliflower and Brussel sprouts and cabbage for that matter). Broccoli-haters: you know what I'm talking about. For you - people that I don't really get and who just love it: all you need to know is that this soup is another glorious way to eat your favorite veggie.</p>
